  journal={Education and Information Technologies},
  abstract = {Bibliometric mapping is widely used in educational technology research to visualize research field development (e.g. the current status and trend). However, there has been limited research examining the present state, challenges, and potential applications of bibliometric mapping techniques in the field of educational technology. In an effort to bridge this knowledge gap, this study conducted a systematic review of 71 articles on bibliometric mapping sourced from 24 journals specializing in educational technology. This review serves as a comprehensive analysis (i.e. a meta-review) of existing reviews in the field. The review focused on productivity, research topics, and research norms. The following key findings were obtained in the study: (1) The field has seen rapid development, with notable author groups, core journals, and major publishing countries; (2) Bibliometric mapping is mainly used for quantitative analysis in five research topics, including specific journals, emerging technologies, learning environments, online and distance learning, and subject concepts; (3) Statistics and evaluations of tools including Bibliometrix package of R language and VOSviewer, databases such as WoS and Scopus, as well as the procedural aspects of the research undertaken, were all considered. Additionally, the study investigated suggested benchmarks for these methods – investigating the availability of recognized reporting guidelines like PRISMA or others, as well as the presence of specific criteria for determining what should be included or excluded when utilizing bibliometric mapping techniques. The study proposed standards for the application of bibliometric mapping techniques in research, accompanied by relevant examples. This study not only reveals the specific value and current applications of bibliometric mapping techniques in educational technology research but also provides clarity on the specific methodologies for their implementation and identifies potential areas for further exploration. Finally, this study puts forth a number of recommendations aimed at fostering the reasoned utilization of bibliometric mapping techniques in the field of educational technology.},

  title={What factors will affect the effectiveness of using ChatGPT to solve programming problems? A quasi-experimental study},
  author={Jing, Yuhui and Wang, Haoming and Chen, Xiaojiao and Wang, Chengliang},
  journal={Humanities and Social Sciences Communications},
  abstract={The emergence of ChatGPT has sparked new expectations for AI-empowered educational transformation. However, it remains unknown which factors affect its effectiveness in empowering learners to solve programming problems. Therefore, this study employed a quasi-experimental research design and used Python graphing in programming education as an example to investigate the factors influencing the effectiveness of learners in applying ChatGPT to problem-solving. Findings: AI literacy significantly influences learners ' effectiveness in using ChatGPT to solve problems, with AI awareness and AI usage being key factors. The knowledge base of programming language significantly affects learners ' effectiveness in applying ChatGPT to solve programming problems. Learners ' cognitive level of ChatGPT significantly influences their effectiveness in applying ChatGPT to problem-solving, while usage intention does not have a significant impact. However, learners ' intention to use ChatGPT significantly improves after application. Based on these findings, this study proposes that in the process of empowering education with Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) products, the focus on learners should shift from cultivating their AI usage to AI literacy, laying the foundation for empowering learning with AIGC products. It is suggested to shift from mastering specific knowledge to graph-based rules as a method for empowering learning with AIGC products. Additionally, the focus should shift from enhancing learners ' intention to use the technology to strengthen their technological awareness, thereby creating practical pathways for empowering learning with AIGC products.},

  author={Wang, Haoming and Wang, Chengliang and Chen, Zhan and Liu, Fa and Bao, Chunjia and Xu, Xianlong},
  journal={Education and Information Technologies},
  abstract={With the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology in the field of education, AI-Agents have shown tremendous potential in collaborative learning. However, traditional Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) methods still have limitations in addressing the unique demands of programming education. This study proposes an innovative AI-Agent-supported Collaborative Learning (AI-CL) approach, aimed at enhancing students' programming learning experience and effectiveness through intelligent assistance from AI-Agents. The research developed an AI-Agent system based on large language models and employed a quasi-experimental design to investigate the effects of the AI-CL method on students' learning achievement, self-efficacy, cognitive load, and learning interest. The experiment was conducted at a university in Shanghai, recruiting 45 undergraduate students who were randomly assigned to the AI-CL experimental group (n = 24) and the CSCL control group (n = 21). The experimental context was set in an ACM programming competition teaching environment, lasting for 6 weeks with 70-min sessions each week. Results showed that the AI-CL group significantly outperformed the CSCL group in learning achievement, self-efficacy, and learning interest. Regarding cognitive load, the AI-CL group demonstrated significantly lower mental effort compared to the CSCL group, while there was no significant difference in mental load. These findings not only provide new theoretical perspectives for the application of cognitive load theory and self-efficacy theory in AI-assisted learning environments but also offer strong practical guidance for higher education institutions to introduce AI-Agent-assisted collaborative learning models in programming courses.},

  title={Breaking the boundaries of conventional vocabulary learning: the impact of vocabulary learning with intelligent interactive companion in CAVL environments on learning outcomes, motivation, and flow experience},
  author={Zhang, Yuxi and Wang*, Haoming and Bao, Chunjia},
  abstract={Vocabulary acquisition is the foundation of language learning, and Computer-Assisted Vocabulary Learning (CAVL) environments offer new possibilities for enhancing learning efficiency. However, conventional CAVL environments often employ static learning content and limited interaction mechanisms, making it difficult to accommodate individual learner differences and cognitive needs, which leads to insufficient motivation and suboptimal memory retention. This study proposed an Intelligent Interactive Companion-assisted Vocabulary Learning (IIC-VL) approach, which was based on multi-agent technology and dynamically adjusted learning content according to learners' proficiency levels, learning styles, and emotional states. An experimental design was adopted, with 100 students recruited from a high school and randomly assigned to an experimental group (n = 49) and a control group (n = 51). The experimental group used the IIC-VL approach for vocabulary learning, while the control group used the conventional CAVL approach. The intervention lasted for 12 wk, with two learning sessions per week, each lasting 45 min. The results showed that, compared to the control group, the experimental group demonstrated significant improvements in vocabulary tests (both receptive and productive), motivation for learning, and flow experience. Subsequent semi-structured interviews revealed students ' positive attitudes and perceptions toward the IIC-VL approach. These findings not only provided empirical support for the application of multi-agent technology in CAVL environments but also offered a new practical direction for personalized learning paths in foreign language vocabulary instruction.},

  abstract={Large language models (LLMs) based Agents are increasingly pivotal in simulating and understanding complex human systems and interactions. We propose the AI-Agent School (AAS) system, built around a self-evolving mechanism that leverages agents for simulating complex educational dynamics. Addressing the fragmented issues in teaching process modeling and the limitations of agents performance in simulating diverse educational participants, AAS constructs the Zero-Exp strategy, employs a continuous “experience-reflection-optimization” cycle, grounded in a dual memory base comprising experience and knowledge bases and incorporating short-term and long-term memory components. Through this mechanism, agents autonomously evolve via situated interactions within diverse simulated school scenarios. This evolution enables agents to more accurately model the nuanced, multi-faceted teacher-student engagements and underlying learning processes found in physical schools. Experiment confirms that AAS can effectively simulate intricate educational dynamics and is effective in fostering advanced agent cognitive abilities, providing a foundational stepping stone from the “Era of Experience” to the “Era of Simulation” by generating high-fidelity behavioral and interaction data.},
