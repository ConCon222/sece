I am **Haoming Wang (王浩名)**, a researcher in the Department of Education 
Information Technology at East China Normal University. My work explores how 
artificial intelligence can meaningfully transform teaching and learning.

## Research Interests

I focus on educational technology innovation, particularly:
- Large language models (LLMs) in education
- AI-assisted teaching and personalized learning
- Multi-agent systems for collaborative learning
- Responsible AI integration in educational contexts

## Methodology

My research employs diverse methodological approaches including quasi-experimental 
designs, lag sequential analysis, epistemic network analysis (ENA), and bibliometric 
methods to rigorously evaluate AI's impact on learning outcomes.

## Current Work

I am currently investigating AI agent empowerment in educational settings, developing 
intelligent assistants that adapt to learner needs while upholding pedagogical 
principles and ethical standards. My work bridges theoretical foundations with 
practical implementation, aiming to create solutions that are both research-informed 
and educationally impactful.
