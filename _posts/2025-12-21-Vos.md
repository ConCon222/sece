This tutorial is based on the methodology used in our recent study on AI in Education {% cite wang2025knowledge %}.

Visualizing the academic landscape is a critical step in conducting a systematic literature review. While **VOSviewer** is a powerful tool, its default layouts can sometimes be messy.

In this post, I will share my workflow for creating publication-ready bibliometric maps by manually editing coordinate data.

## Part 1: The Circular Network Map (Macro-Structure)

This visualization shows the overall topology of the research field using a structured circular layout.

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid 
           loading="eager" 
           path="assets/img/posts/voscircle-graph.png" 
           title="Circular Network Visualization" 
           class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" 
           zoomable=true 
           caption="Figure 1: The macro-structure of the research field using Circular Layout." 
        %}
    </div>
</div>

### How to draw this?
VOSviewer does not generate a perfect circle by default. To achieve this:
1.  **Save** the map data (`.map` and `.net` files) from VOSviewer.
2.  **Edit in Excel:** Open the map file and manually calculate `x` and `y` coordinates using trigonometric formulas (or assign them to specific quadrants).
3.  **Reload** the file into VOSviewer using the "Open" function.

## Part 2: The Vertical Cluster Comparison

This view moves away from the "network" metaphor and adopts a "categorical" metaphor, allowing for a granular comparison of high-frequency keywords within specific sub-domains.

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid 
           loading="lazy" 
           path="assets/img/posts/voscluster-graph.png" 
           title="Cluster Density Visualization" 
           class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" 
           zoomable=true 
           caption="Figure 2: Comparative view of different research clusters (Density View)." 
        %}
    </div>
</div>

### What problem does it explain?
It answers: **"What constitutes each sub-field?"** In Figure 2, we can clearly see the distinct boundaries between clusters. For example, the "Intelligent Agent" cluster is dominated by technical terms, while the "Education" cluster focuses on pedagogical theories. This vertical alignment eliminates visual overlap and confusion.

## Part 3: The Evolutionary Path (Timeline)

Finally, we look at how the field has evolved over the last two decades.

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid 
           loading="lazy" 
           path="assets/img/posts/vostime-graph.png" 
           title="Time Trend Visualization" 
           class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" 
           zoomable=true 
           caption="Figure 3: The temporal evolution of research topics (2004–2024)." 
        %}
    </div>
</div>

### How to draw this?
This is an **Overlay Visualization** with a custom layout:
1.  **Time Alignment:** In the Excel map file, align the **Average Publication Year** to the X-axis (or diagonally from bottom-left to top-right).
2.  **Overlay View:** Switch to Overlay Visualization in VOSviewer.
3.  **Annotations:** Note that the dashed boxes and stage labels (e.g., "Deep Integration") are **added manually** (e.g., in PowerPoint) after exporting the screenshot. VOSviewer does not generate these text boxes automatically.

### Summary
By exporting the map files and manipulating the coordinate data in Excel, we can break free from default layouts and align the visualization strictly with our narrative logic—whether it's circular structure, categorical comparison, or temporal evolution.
